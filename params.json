Since the youtube api does not report locations as lats and lons, I developed a heuristic approach, which uses search radius and 'quad trees' to refine video location.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- youtube_geocoder.js: a node based app to retrieve the urls\r\n\r\nUSAGE: \r\n\r\nnode youtube_geocode.js [text_to_find] [hours_to_sleep] [bbox_lonmin] [bbox_latmin] [bbox_lonmax] [bbox_latmax]  [minradius] [time_to_start] [apikey]\r\n\r\n\r\n* text_to_find: text string to search for\r\n* hours_to_sleep: hours to sleep between trying to find new videos\r\n* bbox_lonmin: longitude min of bbox to search\r\n* bbox_latmin: latitude min of bbox to search\r\n* bbox_lonmax: longitude max of bbox to search\r\n* bbox_latmax: latitude max of bbox to search\r\n* minradius: the min  (in km) from a point radius at which we will attribute a video to a point\r\n* time_to_start: only find videos published after this time\r\n* apikey: the youtube apikey to use (get your own!)\r\n\r\n\r\nexample:\r\n\r\nFind all the earthquake videos within the bounding box for nepal, after the event time.
